# Hakka Nyusu

Hakka Nyusu (Hacker News pronounced in japanese) is a react based HN client.

It connects to the (rudimentary) HackerNews API to pull all the information displayed on screen:

    - Stories (news, top, show, ask and job) and their respective data
    - User Information

Comments and ASK/Tell HN pages will follow very soon.
